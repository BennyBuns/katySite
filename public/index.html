      content="Kati (KAH-TEE) has shared her story of survival with countless school children throughout New England. Her focus is on the next generation who she believes “will save the world”. Her talks invite her audience to take a journey through history as she recounts the details of her early childhood in Nazi-occupied Hungary. 28 members of Kati’s family perished, including her beloved father. Kati is with us today due to the kind and courageous acts of one single person during the final stages of World War II. Her lasting message is to never underestimate the power of one. She reminds students of the power they possess to do the right thing and the importance of acting with compassion to fight against hate and prejudice. She warns against bullying and to embrace others who are different from ourselves. She has engaged adult audiences alike, speaking to groups at historical museums, teacher and administrator conferences, faith groups, and local prisons. Her story of overcoming the unspeakable atrocities of WWII resonates with people from all walks of life. Her message of hope and conquering hateful acts with love and kindness is a message for all of humanity."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
