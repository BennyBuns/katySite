                                ILLUSTRATOR Dilleen Marsh works from her southwestern desert studio in Utah communicating ideas through art.
                                She has illustrated 10 childrenâ€™s books, designed a magazine for teenagers, created an art curriculum for an elementary school, and taught at a university.
                                Dilleen has exhibited and won awards in various shows and galleries, locally, and nationally.
                                For over three years she sketched and wrote a daily Instagram with stories and observations.
                                This led to being included in a sketchbook show in New York City, various PowerPoint presentations, and working on HIDDEN with author Kati Preston in New Hampshire. 
                                You can see her paintings and illustrations at <a href='https://www.dilleenmarsh.com/'>dilleenmarsh.com</a>.
